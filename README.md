MBPUP Linux - remasterable live linux desktop - a fork of Bionic Dog (Ubuntu) 18.04
=

MBPUP Linux is a linux disro remastered by MBinnun, based on the BionicDog Linux distro (which is itself a remastering of Ubuntu Bionic Beaver 18.04).

Unlike BionicDog and any other Puppy-like distro, MBPUP supplies a full featured Lubuntu (Ubuntu + LXDE environment) and intended to run on today's hardware.

Its goal is to have a fully functional desktop from a live CD/USB containing fully supported firmware, but also to be super easy to remaster (so you'll be able to create as many "versions" of your desktop as you like).

Another advantage of MBPUP is the ability to install a functional desktop "as is" to the hard drive (either a standard installation or a frugal one).


** Note: because the ISO images of the release were too large to store on a git, I had to store them on my google drive. Feel free to download from there (links are attached).
